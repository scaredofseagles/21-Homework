## Goal of the Project

***Create a React-based Google Books Search app***

As a full stact web application, I created the front-end using React with the help of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to achieve a responsive design. For complete functionality, Express.js was used to render the server-side code and data was stored and queried using MongoDB with Mongoose as the ODM.
